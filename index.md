## Portable OpenSource HyperRAM controller for FPGAs written in VHDL

HyperRAM is quite a beast! On the one hand, it offers advantages to hardware designers such as
low pin count, low power consumption and easy control. At least compared to modern DDR alternatives.
On the other hand, there are tons of nitty gritty details you need to know to create a stable
and realiable HyperRAM controller. Complex constraints and nasty phase shifts just to name
two of them.

It is hard to find a decent OpenSource 
his repository contains a portable OpenSource HyperRAM controller for FPGAs written in VHDL. I'm writing my own implementation because I've looked at several other implementations, and they all seemed lacking in various regards (features, stability, portability, etc.)

The HyperRAM controller in this repository is a complete rewrite from scratch, and is provided with a MIT license.

Features

This implementation has support for:

    Maximum HyperRAM clock speed of 100 MHz.
    Variable latency.
    Configuration registers read and write
    Identification registers read
    Automatic configuration of latency mode upon reset.
    16-bit Avalon Memory Map interface including burst mode.
    Written for VHDL-2008
